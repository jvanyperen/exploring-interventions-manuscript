# Coronavirus Dashboard

[Coronavirus Dashboard](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/) is maintained by the UK Government, see this page for more information: [About](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/about) for further information. To download data see this page: [Download data](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/download).

If you want to automate, you can use the API instead. To do this in Python, import the [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) module and use the web API, information can be found here: [Web Api](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/developers-guide/main-api). Note the fair use policy here: [Fair Use](https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/download#fair-usage-policy), which we restate here: (true as of _insert date here_)

1. Throttling: Each user is limited to 10 download requests per any 100â€“second period, with a maximum rate limit of 100 per hour.
2. Metric Limit: Each download request may contain up to a maximum number of 5 metrics. This excludes the default metrics.
3. Freshness: Identical requests are only refreshed once every 150 seconds.

## Deaths {#ons-deaths}

Summary: At the beginning of the pandemic, the ONS started to record whether COVID-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. The ONS was already recording deaths by place of occurence at a Local Tier Local Authority level (to be able to differentiate between a death in hospital and a death elsewhere). Since we use data corresponding to the first few months of the pandemic, we use the "2020 edition of this dataset", and use the "Occurrences" dataset rather than the "Registrations".

## Area Codes

Summary: In order to collect the deaths for each of the regions in the analysis, we needed to collect all the Area Codes of the Local Tier Local Authorities that are included in that region. The ONS provide a lookup table for this purpose, and we use the "June 2020 edition of this dataset 2021 local authority boundaries".

## Population Estimates

Summary: For an infectious disease model, it is very helpful to have an estimate on the population size of the hospitals and local authorities (as data reporting and splitting entities). The ONS collects mid-year population estimates for the UK, and splits it by administrative area (wanted), age (not wanted) and sex (not wanted). For the most up-to-date estimates, we use the "Mid-2020 edition" and use the "Summary" (MYE4) dataset.
